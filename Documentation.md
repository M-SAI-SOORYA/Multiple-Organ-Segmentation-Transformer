# Multi-Organ Segmentation using Deep Learning

An **end-to-end Android application** that performs **multi-organ segmentation on Abdomen CT images** using deep learning models. The system integrates **Flutter (frontend)**, **Flask (backend)**, and **cloud deployment on AWS** with models such as **UNETR, UNET, and DETR**.

---

## üìå Objective
- Create a mobile application for multi-organ segmentation  
- Implement transformer-based architectures for segmenting abdominal CT images  
- Integrate the mobile app with deep learning algorithms  
- Deploy the solution on cloud platforms  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Flutter  
- **Authentication**: Google Firebase  
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow  
- **Data Preprocessing**: NumPy, OpenCV  
- **Training Infrastructure**: CPU, GPU, TPU  
- **Deployment**: AWS EC2, Flask API  

---

## üìä Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: Synapse Multi-Organ Segmentation (MICCAI 2015 Multi-Atlas Abdomen Labelling Challenge)  
- **Source**: [Synapse.org](https://www.synapse.org/)  
- **Data Used**: 2 folders from the dataset ‚Üí **4720 images + 4720 masks**  
- **Classes**: 10 organs + 1 background  
- **Preprocessing**: Converted grayscale masks into color-coded masks  

---

## üß† Models Implemented
### 1. **UNETR**
- Vision Transformer encoder + CNN-based decoder with skip connections  
- Handles global context & spatial details  
- Output: 11-class probability distribution (10 organs + background)  

### 2. **UNET**
- Contracting (down-sampling) + expansive (up-sampling) paths  
- Produces segmentation masks with pixel-wise classification  
- Loss: **Categorical Crossentropy**  

### 3. **DETR (Detection Transformer)**
- Transformer-based detection model  
- ResNet-50 backbone for feature extraction  
- Encoder-decoder for object localization & classification

## üî¢ Formulae Used
- Convolution  
- Deconvolution  
- Pooling  
- Batch Normalization  
- Softmax, ReLU, GeLU activation functions  

---

## üì± Frontend (Flutter App)
- **Sign Up / Login** with Firebase  
- **Email & Phone OTP Verification**  
- **Model Selection Page** ‚Üí UNET, UNETR, DETR  
- **Image Upload & Segmentation**:  
  - Upload CT image  
  - Run segmentation (with or without ground truth)  
  - View original, mask, and segmented outputs  

---

## üåê Backend (Flask)
- Loads pre-trained `.h5` models  
- Handles image preprocessing & segmentation inference  
- Encodes segmented images in **Base64** ‚Üí Sends to Flutter app  
- Integrated with AWS EC2 for deployment  

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment
- **AWS EC2 instance (t2.xlarge)**  
- Flask backend hosted on EC2  
- Flutter app communicates via REST API  

---

## ‚ö° Model Training Performance
- **CPU**: ~6 hours per epoch (batch size 2, inefficient)  
- **GPU (Google Colab T4, Kaggle T4√ó2)**: 200s/epoch (batch size up to 8)  
- **TPU (VM v3-8)**: ~60‚Äì100s/epoch (batch size up to 32, most efficient)  

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Platforms Used
- **AWS SageMaker** (not used due to resource issues)  
- **Kaggle** (training)  
- **Google Colab** (training)  
- **VS Code** (development)  
- **Jupyter Lab** (experiments)
